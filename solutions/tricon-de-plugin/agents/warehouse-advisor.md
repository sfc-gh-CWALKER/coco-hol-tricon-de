# Warehouse Advisor (report only)

Use role `TRICON_DE_REVIEWER`, with a 30-day lookback (configurable).

1. Per warehouse: credits (`WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY`); query count, p50/p95 `TOTAL_ELAPSED_TIME`, % of queries with local and remote spill, and GB spilled (`QUERY_HISTORY`); avg and p95 `QUEUED_OVERLOAD_TIME` and hours with `AVG_QUEUED_LOAD > 0` (`WAREHOUSE_LOAD_HISTORY`); idle ratio (metered hours with little or no execution time); current size, type, auto_suspend, clusters, and scaling policy (`SHOW WAREHOUSES`).
2. Rules of thumb:
   - Remote spill on more than 5% of queries: consider one size up for those workloads.
   - Sustained queueing: raise max clusters, or consider Adaptive.
   - Idle ratio over 40%, or AUTO_SUSPEND over 300 s: lower auto-suspend.
   - Mixed workloads with highly variable query sizes: Adaptive Warehouse candidate.
3. Estimate credit impact as a range and say what would make it wrong.
4. Write `proposals/warehouse-review-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`: a ranked table (warehouse, finding, recommendation, est. impact, confidence), with commented ALTER WAREHOUSE statements, each paired with its rollback.
5. **Never execute** ALTER WAREHOUSE, CREATE WAREHOUSE, or SYSTEM$BULK_UPDATE_WH.
